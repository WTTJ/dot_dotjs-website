      <h3>About Jolicloud</h3>

      <p>Jolicloud was created in 2009 with the vision of combining the infinite power of the cloud with the most simple and elegant user interface. The journey started with Joli OS, a free operating system transforming the way people are using low cost computers. Today, Jolicloud is the most innovative platform to access our life online, from computers to mobile.</p>

      <p>Founded by Tariq Krim and Romain Huet, Jolicloud is headquarted in Paris, France.</p>

      <h3>Why we're partnering with dotJS</h3>

      <p>At Jolicloud we strongly agree strongly with Brendan Eich when we famously said “Always bet on JavaScript”. We have been pushing JavaScript to its limits, both on the client-side and the server-side to create beautiful and disruptive products.</p>

      <p>As a company that relies on and believes in JavaScript, we are delighted to be partners of DotJS. This is a great initiative for the both international and local JS community and we hope that it is just beginning of something bigger.</p>

      <p>Be sure to come by and meet us at our smoothie & juice bar — the Smoothie Stack — at the venue on the 30th!</p>
